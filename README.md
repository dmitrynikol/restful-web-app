Example of RESTful application with Spring, Hibernate and JPA
=========================

This is a explanation how to build a RESTful application with Spring, Hibernate and JPA. For this application we’ll also use Maven for build, 
HSQLDB(in memory mode) as database to persist the data, Jetty as a server and JUnit as a standalone testing tool.  In the second part, 
it will be another explanation how to test a service layer through unit and integration tests.
     
The goal of the article is to create a RESTful user manager application which will allow create, delete, update, find, getAll or just get a count of users etc.
